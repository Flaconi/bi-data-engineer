# DESCRIPTION

Welcome to Flaconi's Data Engineering Team Lead Test.
There are two tasks that you need to finish:

## Task 1
We have our DWH well in place and our Data Science team is now looking to build real-time machine learning applications, e.g. for On-Site Product Recommendations using the Kafka infrastructure from our Engineering colleagues. 
How would you build the whole architecture to support Data Science? What challenges do you see for our Data Engineering Team?
Please prepare your thoughts in an informal, but very condensed presentation format (e.g. in PPT (max 3 slides) or what you feel comfortable with) as base for a discussion with the team.

## Task 2
Everyday, our CRM team needs list of Premium customer so they can send a targeted Email campaign. A Premium Customer is customer who bought product with prices within the top 10 percent of it's product category.

Please provide an sql query to get list of Premium Customer. SQL can be written in any syntax (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc)

Data structure and sample data will be provided later.
